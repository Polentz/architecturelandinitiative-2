Title: Schlieren

----

Intro: <p>The well-known experimental factory Stahl-&amp;Traumfabrik AG, with its carpentry, locksmith workshop, and craft <em>know-how</em> pool, has been an established venue in Zurich since the 1990s. In its early days in Zurich-Altstetten, readings, concerts, cultural events of all kinds, and lively celebrations took place among film sets, furniture designs, construction experiments, sculptures, and material archives.</p><p>Since 2020, production has taken place in the protected former drying plant in Schlieren at Bernstrasse 29, with the desire to drive this culture here. In collaboration with Pfeffermint AG and Architecture Land Initiative, a project was initiated to open this space to other companies, practices, creative workers, craftswo.men, and production facilities. The aim is to develop a place in synergy with its productive environment that simultaneously resonates with the rapid transformation of its surroundings.</p>

Careful refurbishment and renewal efforts are then set to restore the architectural, functional, and heritage quality of the valuable existing buildings. </p><p>The initial phase of new construction will feature large, multi-story, stacked commercial halls/buildings on the southern part of the site, designed as a flexible, open structure for workshops and small-scale production. Outdoor spaces and access connect the new building with the existing one, creating attractive meeting spaces among individual workshops. The existing building becomes an integral part of a communal ensemble for production, craftsmanship, and innovation.</p><p>The second phase of new construction introduces a high-volume structure on the street side, serving as an urban accent toward the Limmat area. The scale of the overall project engages in a respectful dialogue with the Gaswerk area, the worker houses in the east, and the employee houses in the west, dating back to the 1910s.</p>",

This goal is to be achieved through a synergy of local resources and innovative new technologies, along with expertise in craftsmanship and hybrid production techniques already available on site.</p><p>The social element of production, oriented toward communal values in production and management, forms a central aspect of the collaborative project. Together, the valuable existing substance of the old drying plant, as well as the newly constructed halls, will support an alternative social economic and production model.</p>",
