            "copy": "<p>With our architectural intervention, we propose to situate the Swiss Art Awards event within the current period of socio-ecological fragmentation. The project consists in a seven-day journey on the Rhine, a fragile territorial body whose living systems transcend national borders, linking disparate localities and milieus. At the same time, visual, sonic and performative transmission devices echo the journey and its evolving landscape within the Basel Messe itself. Acting as a spine of central Europe – from its source in Switzerland to its delta in the North Sea – the Rhine links multiple territories as a structuring social and economic axis. But, throughout its history, the river has also served both as a register for ecological violence and as a catalyst for new environmental narratives and mobilizations. Today, beyond being Europe's busiest river for transport, the river works as a register for slow violence, a gradual process of destruction dispersed across time and space unfolding beyond the threshold of human perception. Building on these qualities, 'Carrier Bag' enacts a vision for socio-ecological repair from Basel to the territories beyond, sensing and transmitting the entanglement of diverse life forms along the Rhine. </p>",

            "copy": "<p>Echoing a Requiem for the Rhine played during the 1986 protest march in response to the Schweizerhalle environmental disaster, the journey will be conducted by a platform – made by mounting re-used container bases on a freight ship – that operates as a stage, resonance body, recording device, and sound transmitter, with the aim to collect, record, and compose a new musical score for the river. The score will live on beyond this seven-day journey in projecting a more desirable future for the territory. While the Carrier bag moves, its panoramic view from the space of the river and the sound score will be transmitted into the Messe. The elements in the Messe consist of a projector, a speaker platform, and a large curtain to receive a projection of the journey and events. Through these spatial devices and the vibrant and pulsating registers they call up, the sensitive experience of the territories crossed, the collective experience and the specific ecological attentions its creates permeate the inner landscape of the Messe.&nbsp;</p>",
