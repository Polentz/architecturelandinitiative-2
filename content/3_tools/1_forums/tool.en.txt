Title: Forums

----

Intro: Forums are the space-time necessary for any shared initiative. They are carefully curated days of shared walks, discussions, meals and discussions in specific places needing renewed attention, imaginaries and care. A forum is the prerequisite for a situated approach based on the sharing of knowledge while taking seriously its entanglements with affects, power relations, tensions and desires. Through this format, we cultivate the power of shared practice itself, and the circulation of embodied knowledge that arises in the exchange of stories and gestures. During these days of collective work, the cartographic and archivistic material we are researching and producing is put at the service of collective (re)tellings and imaginings. We structure the forums with the aim of learning to share our incompleteness.
