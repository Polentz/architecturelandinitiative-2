Title: Atlases

----

Intro: Atlases, as surveys, are an interpretive inquiry in themselves. They present collected on-site and archival materials while simultaneously establishing a common ground for a collective reconfiguration toward the future. As such, atlases allows new propositions to grow from a reframing of spatial and historical entanglements. Through the making of atlases, we engage with the transformative role of survey drawing as a way to thread the topographical, architectural, social, and historical dimensions of places otherwise. Considering the situated and performative dimensions of atlases is, for us, a means of actively revising the authority accorded to representation and the visual in Western culture.
