Title: Meta-themes

----

Intro: Meta-themes are specific words we introduce into collective processes. They are lenses through which to begin questioning dominant imaginaries and establish a common vocabulary with a multiplicity of actors. These themes provide an alternative framing for forum discussions. They also guide our own archival research and cartographic endeavors. Meta-themes cut across disciplines, established categories, and the forces at play, defusing oppositions and rallying energies around alternative trajectories, without these being formulated in a fixed way. These themes highlight the ideologies attached to the vocabularies of spatial and architectural design. They allow us to gradually shift processes towards the establishment of a decentred vocabulary attentive to minor forms of expression and claims.
