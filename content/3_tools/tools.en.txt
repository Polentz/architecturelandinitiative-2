Title: Tools

----

Intro: In recent years, we have developed our own toolshed through our first projects in Switzerland and Hong Kong. The various tools and formats we have designed function as interfaces. They enable us to work with and bring into dialogue different communities, practices, situated social and ecological issues, and the historical dynamics of places in order to read the violence of the spatial dynamics at work, ask better questions and develop collective visions. With our work, we aim to strengthen the power to act and inhabit of the different actors contributing to these processes by weaving a collective and simultaneous transformation of the spatial, the legal and the imaginary, starting with new shared gestures and attentions.
