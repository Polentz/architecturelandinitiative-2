Title: Platform

----

Intro: <p>The platform/practice is a space for learning by doing, where we conduct experiments to shape new initiatives and help develop new models for architectural practice. The platform/practice allows us to define relevant areas of focus, reveal opportunities for action, test informed hypotheses, and share original learning. In doing so, we aim to grow new networks for collaboration and scale the resonance of our work.</p>

By its very nature, drawing, as a discipline, an action, and a mode of inquiry, negotiates such complex systems and lays bare relationships by rendering visible thought, body, and sentiment of the drawing artist and the material, concept, and context with(in) which they are engaged. By marking our understandings of and relationships to, with, and within our environments, drawing becomes an ecological practice and presence onto itself, an action that sites and situates, an act of holistic connection and rapport.&nbsp;When considered as a network of eco-meditations, the drawings exhibited both perform and illustrate drawing’s capacity to question, challenge, and engage, to embody experience and inspire contemplation.</p>",
