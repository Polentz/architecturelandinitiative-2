Title: Atlas

----

Intro: The Atlas as a survey is an interpretive inquiry in and of itself. It presents factual evidence collected on site and in archival materials, and at the same time establishes a common ground for a collective reconfiguration toward the future. To draw is to try meticulously to retain something: to allow it to survive but also to change it. As such, the atlas contains elements of both fact and fiction, and allows new propositions to grow from a reframing of the spatial and historical entanglements. The Atlases are tools to activate and support a trans-scalar understanding: from the territorial to the intimate.  Through making atlases we engage with the transformative role of survey drawing as a way to thread the topographical, architectural, social and historical dimensions of places otherwise. Considering the situated and performative dimensions of atlases is for us a means of engaging in an active revision of the authority accorded to representation and the visual in Western culture.
