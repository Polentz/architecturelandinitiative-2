By its very nature, drawing, as a discipline, an action, and a mode of inquiry, negotiates such complex systems and lays bare relationships by rendering visible thought, body, and sentiment of the drawing artist and the material, concept, and context with(in) which they are engaged. By marking our understandings of and relationships to, with, and within our environments, drawing becomes an ecological practice and presence onto itself, an action that sites and situates, an act of holistic connection and rapport. When considered as a network of eco-meditations, the drawings exhibited both perform and illustrate drawing’s capacity to question, challenge, and engage, to embody experience and inspire contemplation.</p>"},"id":"5cb98a5c-10bb-42ef-bed9-689da5a79047","isHidden":false,"type":"platformblock"},{"content":{"date":"2022-09-01","title":"Experimental Landings","itemtype":"Exhibition","members":"Guillaume Othenin-Girard","topbar":[{"category":"Date","text":"June-October 2022"}],"image":["file://xmjecXctD8X744eV"],"imagecaption":"© 2022 | Pratt School of Architecture","credits":"<p>VENUE: Pratt Institute School of Architecture </p><p>ORGANIZER: Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture </p><p>LOCATION: Governor Island, Nolan Park, Building 14, New York, NY, United States</p><p>EVENT: (ACSA) 2022 Teachers Summit, Architectural Images of Land in the Age of Climate Crisis </p><p>CURATORS: Jonathan A.

By shifting the term from noun to verb, the exhibition seeks to reposition land as an active agent with a broader context, territory, and community. By exploring its \"mediatic\" potential, a critical project may provoke and highlight land's intrinsic ability to engage and inform broader socio-political ans/or climatological consequences. Understood as an elastic and open-ended framework of consideration this collective exhibition of work showcases how architecture and landscape experiments across \"land\" address new definitions of formal practice across the thematics of Artificial Earths, Seeding Resilience, Imaging Ground, and Mapping Maintenance. </p>"},"id":"e935caa2-06c5-46ea-8902-dab2b04d176b","isHidden":false,"type":"platformblock"},{"content":{"date":"2021-11-30","title":"Desert Traces – approaching the Atacama","itemtype":"Exhibition","members":"Guillaume Othenin-Girard","topbar":[{"category":"Date","text":"October-November 2021"}],"image":["file://lRmWdUZfkAQ7O4Na"],"imagecaption":"© 2020 | Biennal SACO","credits":"<p>VENUE: Contemporary Art Biennial SACO 1.0 </p><p>ORGANIZER: Corporación Cultural SACO</p><p>LOCATION: Antofagasta, Chile</p><p>EVENT: Contemporary Art Biennial SACO1.0</p><p>CURATORS: Aluvión [Flood]</p><p>TYPE: Exhibition</p><p>TITLE: <em>Desert Traces – Approaching the Atacama</em></p><p>MEMBERS: Guillaume Othenin-Girard w/ Michael Hirschbichler</p><p>DATE: 06.10.2021-30.11.2021</p><p>PUBLICATIONS: Nitrate Series</p>","info":"<p><a href=\"https://universes.art/en/saco/2021/hirschbichler-othenin-girard\" target=\"_blank\">Universes in Universe</a></p>","body":"<p>The desert landscape and pre-Columbian cosmologies, the mythological crossed by the scientific, run through this project that comes to Antofagasta as a result of the Resonancias (2020) call by the Goethe-Institut and the French Institute in Chile. Using tools from archeology to explore the territory and from astronomy to gather information from the sky and the stars, the artist duo assembles a physical structure that combines this knowledge, with the territory as a receptacle of stories where the interventions function as a concrete link between ancient myths in the present, the Atacama landscape and the immensity of the universe. A landscape covered with structures and traces that look down and up and that, therefore, can be understood as a \"recording\" or a projection surface of events and ideas.</p>"},"id":"37a6560f-41f0-47f9-b303-a073f91697f5","isHidden":false,"type":"platformblock"},{"content":{"date":"2022-10-23","title":"Jardin des Nations - Quartier-Paysage","itemtype":"Exhibition","members":"Zoé Lefèvre, Léonore Nemec, Dieter Dietz, Aurélie Dupuis","topbar":[{"category":"Date","text":"October 2022"}],"image":["file://HL1odJJ5oHqrSdgX"],"imagecaption":"© 2022 | Julien Heil","credits":"<p>VENUE: Museum Ariana</p><p>ORGANIZER: Museum Ariana</p><p>LOCATION: Geneva, Switzerland</p><p>CURATORS: Architecture Land Initiative</p><p>TYPE: Exhibition</p><p>TITLE: <em>Quartier-Paysage, le Jardin des Nations</em></p><p>MEMBERS: Aurélie Dupuis, Dieter Dietz, Zoé Lefèvre, Léonore Nemec</p><p>DATE: 05.10.2022-23.10.2022</p><p>PUBLICATIONS: -</p>","info":"<p><a href=\"https://www.musee-ariana.ch/expositions/quartier-paysage\" title=\"Museum Ariana\">Museum Ariana</a></p>","body":"<p>The Jardin des Nations, a space between city and nature, is a laboratory for ecological transition.
