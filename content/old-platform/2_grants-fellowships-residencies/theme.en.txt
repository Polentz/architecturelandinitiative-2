Today, the Civil Servant Building Societies, are on the verge of disappearance despite being increasingly relevant as housing becomes increasingly inaccessible and individualized around the world. By Us, For Us is a public forum on the history, current problematic, and potential future of housing cooperatives in Hong Kong. In support of the forum, this research will produce a publication, the CBS Estates Atlas, along with a Federative Drawing in order to further distil and disseminate the project. This is the first phase of the larger By Us For Us initiative to establish an action plan to reinstate cooperative housing in the city’s future.</p>"},"id":"81b55c2a-d427-447c-9fb5-7bb45d1b9d49","isHidden":false,"type":"platformblock"},{"content":{"date":"2021-06-30","title":"Hejduk's Masques remain: Drawing, urban performativity and the virtual","itemtype":"Residency","members":"Aurélie Dupuis","topbar":[{"category":"Date","text":"April-June 2021"}],"image":["file://isN9hpn6FNsxKhck"],"imagecaption":"John Hejduk, Soundings: Sketchbook, 1991.

In 2021, the group engages with the idea of the planetary field, i.e. the complex, relational constitution of environments that contemporary architecture makes and inhabits and that are often overlooked and taken for granted. In this context, Aurélie's research, \"Hejduk's Masques Remain,\" explores how Hejduk's masks address the virtual dimensions of the urban and the performative, and what we can still learn from them in this respect, in relation to contemporary architectural practices and how they address movement, time and presence.</p>"},"id":"63b42b61-0310-4b60-91b0-3d2e88dea58d","isHidden":true,"type":"platformblock"},{"content":{"date":"2024-03-01","title":"Swiss Art Awards 2024","itemtype":"Award","members":"Aurélie Dupuis, Dieter Dietz, Guillaume Othenin-Girard, Joshua Guiness, Kent Mundle, Léonore Nemec, Alexa den Hartog, Zoé Lefèvre, Andreas Schrämli","topbar":[{"category":"Date","text":"June 2024"}],"image":["file://V3C7cfLhtSEjzMd7"],"imagecaption":"© 2024 | Raffaella Endrizzi | Basel","credits":"<p>VENUE: Messe Basel</p><p>ORGANIZER: Swiss Federal Office of Culture</p><p>LOCATION: Basel (CH)</p><p>EVENT: Swiss Art Awards 2024</p><p>TYPE: Award</p><p>TITLE: <em>-</em></p><p>GRANTEES: Andi Schrämli, Aurélie Dupuis, Dieter Dietz, Guillaume Othenin-Girard, Joshua Guiness, Kent Mundle, Léonore Nemec, Alexa den Hartog, Zoé Lefèvre</p><p>DATE: 10.06.2024-16.06.2024</p><p>PUBLICATION: forthcoming</p>","info":"<p><a href=\"https://swissartawards.ch/swiss-art-awards/\" title=\"Swiss Art Awards\">Swiss Art Awards</a></p>","body":"<p>The Swiss Art Competition, held annually since 1899, is the world’s oldest art award.

While there has been significant effort to rebuild the rural housing stock, only 38% of the homes in the Kathmandu Valley, Nepal’s most populous urban centre, have been rebuilt. Vernacular construction is deemed too expensive and is becoming obsolete. Changing social and family organisations have furthered the replacement of traditional houses with concrete-framed structures. Land plots are often subdivided, reflecting changes of split ownership between siblings of old family homes that no longer want to live together, resulting in narrow, tall houses that are prone to future structural failure. If urban reconstruction efforts continue this way, the resulting housing stock will be at risk of future seismic events, will not meet future sustainability goals, and will pose a threat to future generations of urban dwellers. This film investigates three portraits that reflect the effects of this transformation from the home to the settlement: A traditional-house on the verge of division; a subdivided-house that has been partitioned by multiple family generations; and a hybrid-house that meshes both traditional and new construction but can no longer meet the needs of its residents.</p>"},"id":"f715bb29-7318-41f6-bc44-0d91c1232e5c","isHidden":false,"type":"platformblock"},{"content":{"date":"2024-04-10","title":"By Us, For Us: Hong Kong Co-operatives, Future-proof Narratives Goals","itemtype":"Grant","members":"Guillaume Othenin-Girard, Kent Mundle","topbar":[{"category":"Date","text":"April-September 2024"}],"image":["file://5Ns38owtJJ0f4070"],"imagecaption":"© 2023 | Architecture Land Initiative","credits":"<p>VENUE: -</p><p>ORGANIZER: DESIGN TRUST an initiative of the Hong Kong Ambassadors of Design</p><p>LOCATION: Hong Kong (HK)</p><p>EVENT: Design Trust 2024 Feature Grant</p><p>TYPE: Grant</p><p>TITLE: <em>By Us, For Us: Hong Kong Cooperatives, Future-proof Narratives Goals</em></p><p>GRANTEES: Guillaume Othenin-Girard, Kent Mundle</p><p>DATE: 01.04.2024-30.09.2024</p><p>PUBLICATION: -</p>","info":"<p><a href=\"https://designtrust.hk/newsletter/new-grants-cycle-with-2024-theme-archiving-futures-design-trust-2024-january-cycle-grant-recipients/\" title=\"Design Trust\">Design Trust</a></p>","body":"<p>Architecture Land Initiative has been awarded a second Design Trust grant. With this grant for the project \"By Us, For Us: Hong Kong Co-operatives, Future-proof Narratives Goals,\" the collective expands on the first stage of a research on Civil Servant Building Societies (CBS) as an alternative housing model. There was a period in Hong Kong when the public had a stake in the formation of the urban settlement in the model of CBS, extending from the apartment to the yard, street front, block, and collective neighborhood. The project looks both to this past and to the future. It unfolds as two public forums, a publication, and an international exhibition, which together aim to chart a roadmap towards pilot proto-projects involving diverse stakeholders and communities.</p>"},"id":"9965f46b-550c-40a4-bd35-87bda64468db","isHidden":false,"type":"platformblock"}]
