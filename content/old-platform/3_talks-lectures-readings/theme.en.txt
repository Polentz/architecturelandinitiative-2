Ways of linking our gestures beyond the false boundaries of the individual and the human. Ways of dancing-feeling-thinking the entanglement of our movements. </p>"},"id":"bf41df57-e580-4d62-923f-48a813f14ad6","isHidden":false,"type":"platformblock"},{"content":{"date":"2022-09-16","title":"Jardin des Nations – Experimental Planification","itemtype":"Lecture","members":"Aurélie Dupuis, Léonore Nemec","topbar":[{"category":"Date","text":"September 2022"}],"image":["file://aC5Ko0lDwVSYnaFb"],"imagecaption":"© 2023 | Priska Ketterer | Luzern","credits":"<p>VENUE: BSA-Tagung 2022</p><p>ORGANIZER: BSA-FAS</p><p>LOCATION: Luzern, Switzerland</p><p>TYPE: Lecture</p><p>TITLE: <em>Experimental Planification - Jardin des Nations</em></p><p>SPEAKERS: Aurélie Dupuis and Léonore Nemec</p><p>DATE: 16.09.2022</p><p>PUBLICATION: -</p>","info":"<p><a href=\"https://www.bsa-fas.ch/en/a/1038-bsa-tagung-2022/\" title=\"BSA-FAS\">BSA-FAS</a></p>","body":"<p>The Swiss Federation of Architects (BSA-FAS) organized the FAS 2022 Day on the theme of experimental planning.

New Narratives of the European City. It focuses on the different ways in which urban planning is narrated. Aurélie's contribution to the conference builds on the project of <em>Jardin des Nations</em> realised with Architecture Land Initiative. It aims to shed light on the transformative potential of transmedia storytelling and participatory design as a way not only to reach broader audiences but, foremost, to include under-considered voices and practices in urban planning narrative practices and provide them with the means of production of the future. As such, transmedia storytelling are framed as a promising path to unlearn what we think about technology, the future, public space, “solution stories” and to foster a transformative change in narrative and urban relations.</p>"},"id":"d760abc8-d8cf-4db4-a0ce-303874fac474","isHidden":false,"type":"platformblock"},{"content":{"date":"2023-11-25","title":"A Tribute to Minnie Bruce Pratt","itemtype":"Reading","members":"Zoé Lefèvre","topbar":[{"category":"Date","text":"November 2023"}],"image":["file://RKkceACFKApQc4bi"],"imagecaption":"© 2023 | Zoé Lefèvre","credits":"<p>VENUE: ZW-2 | 2 Years Zentralwäscherei</p><p>ORGANIZER: Zentralwäscherei</p><p>LOCATION: Zurich, Switzerland</p><p>TYPE: Collective reading</p><p>TITLE: <em>A Tribute to Minnie Bruce Pratt</em></p><p>SPEAKERS: Zoé Lefèvre &amp; Chloé Detchart</p><p>DATE: 25.11.2023</p><p>PUBLICATION: fanzine produced during the event available on request </p>","info":"<p><a href=\"https://zentralwaescherei.space\" title=\"Zentralwäscherei\">Zentralwäscherei</a></p>","body":"<p>The Zentralwäscherei cultural venue marked its second anniversary with a festival celebrating its two years of existence, the struggle to offer affordable and accessible cultural events, and the coming together of culture, politics and the arts.

Houghton Jr. Gallery on Saturday, April 9, from 10 am to 3 pm. This four-part program included project presentations by individuals who contributed to the exhibition and discussions addressing critical questions in the conception of civic space. In this context, Dieter and Aurélie discussed the idea of <em>landscape as a support</em> where landscape is understood as a complex entanglement of matter and uses, of ecology and culture, that can function as scaffolding to support the cohabitation of new urban experiences and cohabitations. </p>"},"id":"b7c2321d-f365-4999-a90e-e9326b97bdef","isHidden":false,"type":"platformblock"},{"content":{"date":"2023-09-23","title":"Unearthing Embodied Architectural Precedents","itemtype":"Talk","members":"Aurélie Dupuis","topbar":[{"category":"Date","text":"September 2023"}],"image":["file://DX4XHZiwC0b96npt"],"imagecaption":"© 2023 | Aurélie Dupuis","credits":"<p>VENUE: Agora II Symposium - (Un)Common Precedents</p><p>ORGANIZER: CRIPTIC Azrieli School of Architecture &amp; Urbanism</p><p>LOCATION: Ottawa, Canada</p><p>TYPE: Talk</p><p>TITLE: <em>Unearthing Embodied Architectural Precedents</em></p><p>SPEAKERS: Aurélie Dupuis</p><p>DATE: 23.09.2023</p><p>PUBLICATION: forthcoming</p>","info":"<p><a href=\"https://www.criptic.org/agora-2\" title=\"Criptic\">Criptic</a></p>","body":"<p>What happens when precedents are drawn from outside the discipline and translated into architecture through the design process? The Agora II Symposium tackles this issue by posing the question(s): How do architects build a frame of reference? In architecture, what does the current approach to precedent study leave out? Which are the under acknowledged and (un)common precedents that inspire architectural design in terms of diversity of media, culture and socio-political contexts? In her contribution, Aurélie considers movements and bodies as architectural knowledge and traces. She examines how embodied architectural precedents of various kinds and performance as activation become a performative means of spatial production and imagination. Consideration of embodied precedents reveals the mechanisms of standardization at work in architectural production, and helps affirming richer assemblages of gestures, affects, materialities and temporalities in space. </p>"},"id":"6fec9dd0-1570-4874-80a9-612a1ea76f23","isHidden":false,"type":"platformblock"},{"content":{"date":"2023-10-09","title":"Vision Jardin des Nations","itemtype":"Lecture","members":"Léonore Nemec","topbar":[{"category":"Date","text":"October 2023"}],"image":["file://GJoKQnJjoOI1j8Fu"],"imagecaption":"© 2021 | Architecture Land Initiative","credits":"<p>VENUE: EPFL Conferences</p><p>ORGANIZER: EPFL IA ALICE laboratory </p><p>LOCATION: Lausanne, Switzerland</p><p>TYPE: Lecture</p><p>TITLE: <em>Vision Jardin des Nations</em></p><p>SPEAKERS: Léonore Nemec</p><p>DATE: 09.10.2023</p><p>PUBLICATION: -</p>","info":"<p><a href=\"https://memento.epfl.ch/event/jardin-des-nations-alice-2/\" title=\"Event EPFL\">Event EPFL</a></p>","body":"<p>As part of the regular lectures organized by the architecture department at EPFL Lausanne, Léonore was invited by the ALICE laboratory to present the research carried out by the Architecture Land Initiative collective on the Jardin des Nations.</p>"},"id":"26089f23-8719-4ae9-be01-3ae65fead884","isHidden":false,"type":"platformblock"},{"content":{"date":"2021-03-05","title":"Becoming Léman – Travels Beyond Borders","itemtype":"Lecture","members":"Dieter Dietz","topbar":[{"category":"Date","text":"May 2021"}],"image":["file://DsTSiOw1omvR68tQ"],"imagecaption":"© 2021 | Hong Kong University","credits":"<p>VENUE: HKU Public Lecture Series </p><p>ORGANIZER: Hong Kong University</p><p>LOCATION: Hong Kong, Hong Kong</p><p>TYPE: Lecture</p><p>TITLE: <em>Becoming Léman – Travels Beyond Borders</em></p><p>SPEAKERS: Dieter Dietz</p><p>DATE: 05.03.2021</p><p>PUBLICATION: -</p>","info":"<p><a href=\"https://www.arch.hku.hk/event_/dieter-dietz/\" title=\"HKU Public Lecture Series\">HKU Public Lecture Series</a></p>","body":"<p>How can architecture and education contribute to an understanding of a project beyond mere design and construction? How can we engage the instruments of architecture in order to overcome the linear understanding of commands and execution that are present in highly specialized societies? <em>Becoming Léman</em> is an emergent project situated around the Lake of Geneva, combining research with a broad range of educational formats and actual projects. Our hypothesis posits that the linearity of an approach based on diagnosis and consequent ‘solutions’ is itself fundamentally problematic – embedded in a culture that segregates ‘thinking’ from ‘making’ and thus leading to a segregated world. To overcome this dichotomy, <em>Becoming Léman</em> works with ‘vectors’ that continue to activate projects in evolutionary and emerging nature. The imagination and work of many individuals articulate collective transformations of places through situated projects in evolutionary transductive processes. </p>"},"id":"d88f82d5-daa6-4b5a-96d3-353d9ad018d3","isHidden":false,"type":"platformblock"},{"content":{"date":"2023-11-17","title":"Illuminating New Rural Asia","itemtype":"Talk","members":"Kent Mundle","topbar":[{"category":"Date ","text":"November 2023"}],"image":["file://H0R1shb58zNuiDgh"],"imagecaption":"© 2023 | District Development Unit","credits":"<p>VENUE: Future Rural Symposium</p><p>ORGANIZER: Architectural Association Public Programme &amp; Yuki Sumner</p><p>LOCATION: London, United Kingdom</p><p>TYPE: Talk</p><p>TITLE: <em>Illuminating New Rural Asia</em></p><p>SPEAKERS: Kent Mundle</p><p>DATE: 17.11.2023</p><p>PUBLICATION: -</p>","info":"<p><a href=\"https://www.aaschool.ac.uk/publicprogramme/whatson/future-rural-casting-a-non-western-gaze-on-the-rural-urban-dichotomy\" title=\"Architectural Association\">Architectural Association</a></p>","body":"<p>Following on from the exhibition, “The Future is Rural,” curated by Yuki Sumner for the London Design Biennale in June 2023, this symposium showcased artist-led activities and grassroots initiatives aimed at revitalising rural Japan and beyond. The symposium also presented research being conducted in parts of rural China, Mongolia and Pakistan, highlighting some of the tensions that exist between urban and rural conditions in these contexts, as well as the challenges that rural communities face. The event questioned what the best approach could be when readdressing the structural imbalance that exists in the relationship between the rural and the urban in these geographies. In this context, Kent shared the work he conducts with the District Development Unit (DDU) in Mongolia, Nepal, and the Philippines, as well as the broader DDU position on the role of the architect. </p>"},"id":"09b4b070-db6f-4e54-b853-3e63cdfd1ba3","isHidden":false,"type":"platformblock"},{"content":{"date":"2024-03-21","title":"Head Houses and Volcanoes","itemtype":"Lecture","members":"Guillaume Othenin-Girard","topbar":[{"category":"Date","text":"March 2024"}],"image":["file://d2g8pI8BbIE7kPgv"],"imagecaption":"© 2024 | Università Iuav di Venezia","credits":"<p>VENUE: IUAV Public Conferences</p><p>ORGANIZER: Università Iuav di Venezia</p><p>LOCATION: Venice, Italy</p><p>TYPE: Lecture</p><p>TITLE: <em>Head Houses and Volcanoes</em></p><p>SPEAKERS: Guillaume Othenin-Girard</p><p>DATE: 21.03.2024</p><p>PUBLICATION: -</p>","info":"<p><a href=\"https://www5.iuav.it/homepage/index.htm\" title=\"IUAV\">Università IUAV di Venezia</a></p>","body":"<p>Guillaume gave a conference as part of the IUAV lecture series in Venice.
