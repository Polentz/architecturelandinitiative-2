Its primary focus lies in exploring the role of drawing within the educational programs of Swiss universities and architectural practices. Drawing is examined in its dual capacity, both as an object and as a method for teaching and practicing architecture. In his contribution, Guillaume demonstrates how drawing, as a survey, serves as a means of embedding architectural actions in the world. The atlases he collaboratively creates with his students underscore the significance of assessing architecture across multiple scales, extending beyond the building itself. This transscalar approach aims to promote awareness of architects' social and environmental responsibilities, interwoven with both past and contemporary narratives throughout the design process.</p>"},"id":"8bc8d1a3-551f-4974-b826-817f1740b17a","isHidden":false,"type":"platformblock"},{"content":{"date":"2023-10-06","title":"Silence, on surélève","itemtype":"Article","members":"Léonore Nemec","topbar":[{"category":"Date","text":"October 2023"}],"image":["file://qdz8vpnVkhwX4orO"],"imagecaption":"© 2023 | Joël Tettamanti","credits":"<p>TYPE: Article </p><p>TITLE: <em>Silence, on surélève</em></p><p>ISSUE: Su­ré­le­ver la Suisse </p><p>AUTHORS: Léonore Nemec</p><p>DATE: 06.10.2023</p><p>PUBLISHER: TRACÉS </p><p>ISBN: on-line</p>","info":"<p><a href=\"https://www.espazium.ch/fr/actualites/silence-sureleve\" title=\"Tracés 02 11 2023\">Tracés</a></p>","body":"<p>To tackle the housing crisis without systematic demolition, why not elevate the whole of Switzerland?

Since the 1980s, through architectural drawing and writing, John Hejduk has been developing the «masques» as an architectural repertoire of characters for cities. «Bovisa» (1986) is one of them.

In this conversation they discuss how his early experience of living and working in the desert in Niger influenced his way of thinking about urban space and housing, and how silence can be understood as a quality in reimagining architecture in relation to the city: «It is a place where you can start dreaming, you can start thinking, you can start inventing.

This reading of contemporary urbanization allows us to discover effective levers through which to tackle the discontents of suburbia. In examining the generic nature of Los Angeles, thinking of architecture as the design of singular, stimulating spaces won’t get you very far.
