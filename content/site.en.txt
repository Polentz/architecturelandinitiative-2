Their office is a co-founder of Architecture Land Initiative. Alexa is interested in the duality between the theoretical conception of architecture and its realisation. For her, architecture is a built form of political ideas and must therefore be treated with empathy at its core. Next to her design practice she is involved in teaching and professional organisations.
